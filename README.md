# TinyAuth

Hi! This is my very first time trying to create a npm package. TinyAuth is a module to help developers handle authentication

## Technologies

TinyAuth is built on top of:

1. **bcrypt**: For hashing
2. **jsonwebtoken**: For working with **JWTs** (JSON Web Tokens)

## Motivation

Most of the solutions available didn't meet my needs, I guess and the one I wanted to use [(supertokens)](https://supertokens.com) dosen't have full support for MongoDB yet.

Plus, it's fun!

## Disclaimer

This package is built in a very specific way, to complement how I work with authentication. So it may lack some feautures you think should be there

If you still want to use it nonetheless, Feel free and you can also check my [GitHub](https://github.com/Ikuewumi) for other stuff I do.

PLease feel free to comment on **anything** you want about the code or just in general.

Happy Coding,
Ayobami Ikuewumi
